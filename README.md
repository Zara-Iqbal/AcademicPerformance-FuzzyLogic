Students academic success is evaluated by their performance in exams conducted by the institutes or Universities. Considering
the high demand of IT professionals and the gap between academia and IT Industry it is important that we must explore the
possibilities of automated system which can effectively evaluate the performance of students in computer science and IT related
courses. 

For last few years, fuzzy logic theory is being used in the education system. Implementation of the fuzzy logic for various
activities of assessment of studentsâ€™ performance such as evaluation of answer scripts of students in an examination,
evaluation of lab examination, projects evaluation and many more. Fuzzy rules have been developed to check how
fuzzy rules can be used to model and evaluate the achievement of the learning outcomes in information systems courses. It
was proposed to use of the fuzzy set technique to be applied in the evaluation process of the industrial automation systems
learning area, which aimed to lessen the evaluation complexity and ambiguity
